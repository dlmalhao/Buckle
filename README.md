### Description
Buckle is a full website designed to help and to connect all students of a certain college.
It counts with 3 main sections:

- Announcements
- Projects
- Student Council

The first one provides a space for the students to ask and answer questions of each others, as well as providing help in projects for students from other degrees. It works more like a forum.

The second one is a space to post college projects so they can be shown to other students in order to give them inspiration.

The last one provides a space that only Student's council members can post. It's objective is to post only college related subjects.


Finally it also have a customizable profile page so that the students can save liked posts and projects.

It was made in Vue JS with a self-made API (heroku) and a MySQL data-base.
